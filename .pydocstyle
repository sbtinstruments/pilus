# D100: Missing docstring in public module.
# D104: Missing docstring in public package (e.g., in `__init__.py`)
#       We never use module and package docstrings anyhow. We just read
#       the documentation for the classes and functions.
#       
# D105: Missing docstring in magic method (e.g., `__enter__` and `__exit__`)
#       Most of these methods are self-explanatory. Do write a docstring
#       if your magic method does something "unexpected".
#
# D106: Missing docstring in public nested class.
#       This one is more trouble than it's worth. Pydantic, for instance,
#       use nested `Config` classes. This results in a lot of false
#       positives.
#
# D107: Missing docstring in __init__ method
#       The docstring for the class itself is enough on its own.
